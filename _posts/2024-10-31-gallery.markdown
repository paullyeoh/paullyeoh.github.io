    <a href="img/gallery/originalDnDParty.jpg" data-fancybox="gallery" data-caption="<b>Katie Fletcher, <em>Original Party Portrait</em> (2019). </b>One of the most exciting aspects of D&D is the way imaginative activity inspires yet more imagining. Never was the self-fueling nature of collective storytelling clearer to me than in the fall of 2019, when DM Matt Hale’s imaginative powers inspired the entire group to engage in a range of creative activities. Not only did we participate in communal storytelling at the gaming table, outside of sessions people were writing, drawing—even composing music—to flesh out our shared fictional world. To illustrate, here is the very first portrait of the party, by Katie Fletcher (2019). Her simple yet charming digital illustration captures both the colorful individuality and the innocence of our level-1 characters (from left: Travis, Wynlynn, Val, Teal, Pantaghion, Agenar, and Tilia).">

Years ago, when I first sat down to imagine Teal, I quickly found you can’t invent a person without a place. And so the Island of Talpin came into being. At first little more than an assemblage of facts to explain Teal’s backstory, the island became more concrete over the course of the D&D campaign, but the characters never made it to Teal’s island home. Only after the campaign ended, when I embarked on my post-adventure story, did I sit down with DM Matt to work out the island’s topography and the layout of its town. Over the last two years, I thought I’d become thoroughly familiar with Talpin. Still, when Sri Lankan digital artist Janith Tharaka rendered a view of Talpin based on passages from the novel, it was not only a homecoming, but also like seeing the island for the first time.
